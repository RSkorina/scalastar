# scalastar

The purpose of this repository is to create a web application that generates warrior cat names based on some identifying features. Link to the original game can be found (here)[https://web.archive.org/web/20051013063148/http://warriorcats.com/name.html]  

## Plan for Framework

### main
    runs the program. For starters this is just going to be the front end. (This may expand once the Frontend becomes technical)

### Front End: 
    Handles the creation of the front end. For Scalastar 1.0 This will require Just a terminal

### Generators
    File that contains all the different types of generators
    Each one will have input and output information

    Original Methodology
        Using the same original values as the first game. 
        input First Name Last name
        FIle small enough. No need for File

    Russell Methodology
        Using a more advanced methodology to be established later. Some sort of non-reversable, more labor intensive version original
### data
    Database for all names, Includes path to each

    prefix.csv

## Testing: 
   Each file will have one of the same tests. Each Test will be a unit test.
   This is a tiny application. There is no use for Mid level, or integration tests.

   


## Backburner: 

Use sentiment analysis and (this)[https://wcrpforums.com/thread/1973/jackals-warrior-name-guide] data to provide a more accurate 

Build a Database for names? Probably not worth it from a performance standpoint but a fun thing to try
